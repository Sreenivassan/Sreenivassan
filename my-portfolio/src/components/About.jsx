      <p>
        I’m a passionate Web Developer with nearly 4 years of experience
        building scalable and secure web applications, primarily using React. I
        specialize in creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces that
        prioritize performance, maintainability, and user experience. Starting
        with a strong foundation in UI/UX, I translated wireframes into clean,
        consistent designs using modern frontend tools and frameworks. Over
        time, I progressed into developing robust frontend architectures,
        focusing on reusable components, performance optimization, and secure
        coding practices. Collaboration is a key part of my process. I’ve worked
        closely with designers and backend developers to align technical
        solutions with business goals. I also contribute to improving
        development workflows through version control, code reviews, and
        documentation, promoting team efficiency and high-quality deliverables.
        I’m always exploring new technologies and design patterns to stay
        current in the fast-evolving web ecosystem. Whether refining a user
        journey or architecting a scalable UI, I approach every challenge with
        attention to detail and a drive for excellence.
